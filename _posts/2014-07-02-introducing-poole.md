I decided to update my blog for various reasons, and while googling around for Jekyll themes, I stumbled across Poole by mdo. I was struck by the simplicity and elegance of the Lanyon theme.

  <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole</a> is the butler for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, the static site generator. It's designed and developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a> to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.
