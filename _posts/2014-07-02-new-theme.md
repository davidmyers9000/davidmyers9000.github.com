I wanted my <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> site to have a minimalistic design, and while searching for Jekyll themes, I stumbled across [Poole](http://getpoole.com/). In the canonical short story by <cite>Robert Loius Stevenson</cite> Poole is the butler for Dr. Jekyll. So it's a fitting name for the black & white designed theme. The simplicity of the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme was just what I envisioned. Humbly, I forked the repo by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>, but made a few modifications as well such as equipping it with some `rake` command line tools which you can checkout on this site's [github repository]({{site.github.repo}}).
