I decided to update my <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> blog to a more simple design, and while googling around for Jekyll themes, I stumbled across [Poole](http://getpoole.com/). In the canonical short story by <cite>Robert Loius Stevenson</cite> Poole is the butler for Dr. Jekyll. So it's a fitting name for the black & white designed theme. Upon digging deeper, I was struck by the simplicity and elegance of the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme. Each theme was designed and developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>, but I took a few liberties and made a few modifications. Including equipping it with some `rake` command line tools which you can checkout on this site's [github repository]({{site.github.repo}}).
