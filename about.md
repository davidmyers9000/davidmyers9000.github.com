Currently, I am working at [School of Biomedical Engineering (BIOMED)](https://drexel.edu/biomed) while studying for an MS in Information Systems, Minoring in Health Informatics at the [College of Computing and Informatics (CCI)](https://drexel.edu/cci) at Drexel University.

Previously, I worked for a [Dreamit Health](https://www.dreamit.com/healthtech/) startup called <strong>Fitly<sup>TM</sup></strong> now known as [SmartPlate <sup>TM</sup>](https://getsmartplate.com) to fight the childhood obesity epidemic by making healthy food more accessible and affordable.

My undergraduate degree in [Digital Media](http://digm.drexel.edu/reels/) is from Drexel University with emphasis on fundamental pillars: `Computer Animation`, `Game Development`, and `Web Design`.
