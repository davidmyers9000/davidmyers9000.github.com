Currently working at Drexel University's [School of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.facebook.com/DrexelBIOMED) improving their web and multimedia enigines. Previously, I worked for one of [Dreamit Health's](https://www.dreamitventures.com/programs/dreamithealth/dreamit-health/) startup companies building its marketing and design aesthetic. Before that in 2012, I graduated Drexel University with a B.S. in [Digital Media](http://digm.drexel.edu/reels/) with practical skills in Computer Animation, Game Design, and Web Design.
